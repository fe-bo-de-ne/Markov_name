# Markov_name

.net 7.0 conversion of the p5.js markov name generator from The Coding Train's https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r8CmofnbAQ

I've added command line arguments to play with the n-gram order, the size of the generated name and to specify the number of names to create.
The names.txt is the same from the p5 code.
I left commented two statement to output the markov chain and beginnings dicts into JSON
